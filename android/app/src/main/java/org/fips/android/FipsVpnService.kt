/**

 * The tunnel captures all traffic of the selected apps: `fd00::/8` goes to
 * the mesh, everything else reaches the shim's userspace forwarder, which
 * sends it back out on protected sockets. The IPv6 default route (`::/0`) is
 * claimed only while the underlying network actually has IPv6 internet:
 * the forwarder's userspace TCP stack SYN-ACKs a captured app's connect
 * before dialing the real destination, so a claimed-but-undeliverable `::/0`
 * would turn every IPv6 connect into a hang (Happy Eyeballs sees a working
 * connection and never falls back to IPv4) instead of a fast v4 fallback.
