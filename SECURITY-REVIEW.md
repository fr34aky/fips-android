# Security review context for fips2go

Security review here is done by hand, as part of the PR review in
`PR-REVIEW.md` (there is no automated scanner in CI any more). This file is
the context that review needs: where this codebase's trust boundaries
actually are, so findings can be weighted accordingly, and which deliberate
design choices are not findings.

## What this is

An Android `VpnService` app embedding the FIPS mesh daemon. A Rust shim
(`shim/`) runs the node in-process and owns the TUN file descriptor; the Kotlin
app (`android/`) owns the tunnel, the per-app split tunnel and the UI.
Everything crosses JNI as JSON strings.

## Untrusted input, in rough order of exposure

1. **Packets from the mesh.** Any authorized node on a ~1000-node public mesh
   can send arbitrary IPv6 traffic at this device. `shim/src/filter.rs`
   (stateful inbound firewall), `shim/src/packet.rs` (hand-rolled IPv6/UDP
   parsing and checksums) and `shim/src/pump.rs` (the mesh/clearnet classifier)
   all parse it. Parser bugs here are remotely reachable.
2. **Packets from covered apps** heading out through the TUN, including
   intercepted DNS to the `fd00::53` sentinel (`shim/src/dns.rs`).
3. **DNS responses** from configured upstreams, parsed in `shim/src/dns.rs`.
   (`answer_as_asked` there also parses a reply, but only the in-process
   responder's on `[::1]`, for a name out of the user's own hosts file.)
4. **GitHub release metadata and the downloaded APK** in
   `android/.../Updater.kt`.
5. **Nostr relay traffic**, handled inside the fips dependency rather than here.
6. **The Mesh names sync answer** (opt-in, off by default): the upstream
   node's `/api/hosts` JSON, fetched over the mesh by the in-process TCP client
   in `shim/src/meshhttp.rs` and parsed in `android/.../HostsSync.kt`. Only the
   npub the user named can answer from its address, so the source is
   authentic — but it is still a remote party writing names into this
   device's `.fips` resolution (a synced name overrides a local one by design,
   as in fips-ui). The HTTP parsing is bounded (4 MiB body, chunked decoding
   checked), entries are validated like hand-typed ones and capped at 2000.
   The reply tap (`Divert`) sits in front of the inbound firewall, but only
   claims packets matching an open in-process flow's exact (remote address,
   remote port, local port) — it cannot admit anything to a covered app.

## Things that would be serious in this codebase

- **Inbound firewall bypass.** `filter.rs` default-denies new inbound flows and
  permits only replies to outbound-initiated flows, ICMPv6, and an explicit
  port allowlist. Any path that lets an unsolicited packet reach a covered app
  re-exposes every listening port on the phone to the whole mesh.
- **Flow-table abuse.** The 4-tuple table is bounded and idle-expiring; look
  for unbounded growth, or a remote party being able to forge a state entry.
- **Packet parsing.** Out-of-bounds reads, integer overflow in length or offset
  arithmetic, extension-header/fragment handling, and checksum logic. Note the
  design intent that non-TCP/UDP/ICMPv6 next-headers are dropped *unparsed*.
- **Identity handling.** The node secret (nsec) is sealed by a non-exportable
  Android Keystore key (`SecureStore.kt`, `IdentityStore.kt`). Flag anything
  that writes it in plaintext, logs it, puts it in an Intent, or widens where
  it can be read. The backup/restore feature in `OverviewFragment.kt`
  deliberately reveals it on screen and to the clipboard — that is intended,
  but check the clipboard is flagged sensitive and that `deriveIdentity` is
  never handed an empty string (which means "generate", and would silently mint
  a new identity while claiming to restore one).
- **Tunnel leaks.** Every underlay socket must be passed to
  `VpnService.protect()`, or its traffic routes back into the tunnel. Missing
  protection, or a socket created on a path that skips the hook, is a real
  finding.
- **Updater integrity.** `Updater.kt` must verify the downloaded APK against
  the release `.sha256` before handing it to the package installer, and must
  not fall back to installing an unverified file.
- **JNI boundary.** `shim/src/jni_api.rs` must not let a panic unwind across
  the boundary, and must handle malformed JSON and non-UTF-8 strings.

## Deliberate design choices — not findings

- The inbound firewall's default allowlist is empty and fips needs no inbound
  TUN ports; that is intentional, not a misconfiguration.
- `enable_nostr` and the in-app `.fips` resolver are hardcoded on.
- The nsec is shown in cleartext by the Back up dialog by design.
- Mesh names (`files/hosts`) are stored in plaintext in the app's private
  dir: they hold npubs — public keys — and labels, and the shim has to read
  the file. Only `.fips` queries from covered apps consult it; nothing
  arriving from the mesh can probe the name space.
- `android-env.sh` pins `LIBCLANG_PATH` to override a bad machine-wide value;
  that is a build-environment workaround, not a hardcoded secret.
- Release signing happens on a workstation, never in CI. There is deliberately
  no signing key in GitHub secrets.
