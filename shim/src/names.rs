//! Public domain names over fips (`www.example.org` → a mesh node), the
//! phone half of fr34aky/fips-pub-domains: `pubdom-core` decides,
//! `pubdom-resolve` talks to relays and the legacy DNS, and this module
//! supplies what only
//! the phone can — the mesh transport (`meshudp.rs`) and the identity
//! registration through the in-process responder — and runs the lookup
//! from the DNS proxy's blocking per-query thread.
//!
//! Order of business for a non-`.fips` name (fips-pub-domains spec §5–§7):
//! local pins, then — online — the `_fips-dns.<domain>` TXT record from the
//! configured upstreams, a claim from the relays only after a TXT hit (or,
//! offline, a claim from a relay on the mesh whose DNSSEC proof verifies),
//! step
//! 3 to the domain's server over the mesh, and a synthesized answer with the
//! node's `fd…` address. Everything else is [`Outcome::Legacy`], and the
//! proxy forwards to the upstreams exactly as before — or
//! [`Outcome::Pending`] when the lookup overran its budget and is still
//! deciding, which forwards too but with the answer's TTLs capped,
//! [`Outcome::Capped`] when the name is over fips but nobody is reachable
//! right now (the cap lasts until the next attempt), or
//! [`Outcome::Early`] when one upstream has already denied the record and
//! the legacy answer need not wait for the rest. A name that is not over
//! fips is never made unreachable by this code.
